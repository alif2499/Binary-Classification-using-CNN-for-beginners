# Car Vs Truck Image-Classification-using-Convolutional Neural Network-for-beginners.

## Introduction
Here, a Convolutional Neural Network is implemented to perform the classification between car or truck.

## Dataset Description
The dataset for classification task can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/ryanholbrook/car-or-truck. The dataset contains two folders containing the training and validation data. In each of the train and valid directory there are two other sub directories for car and truck. The dataset is image type and CNN is best for image classfication task.
